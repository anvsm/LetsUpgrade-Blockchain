Ans). Security, Authenticity and third party trust

3). What are the few features that Blockchain will give you?

Ans). a) Decentralization
          b) Security
          c) Data Transperacy
          d) Verifiability
          
4). What all things does a block contain?

Ans). a) Data
          b) No.of Transactions
          c) Hash key
          d) Mining key
          e) Gas limit
          f) Gas Used
          
5). How is the verifiabilty of the Blockchain attained?

Ans). As data is shared among all the computers in a network, whenever data 
         has been changed at the first computer the signature(hash key) will be changed,
         then the correct data can be taken from the other computers which are in the 
         network and can we can verify which data is correct. 
         This proves the verifiability of the data in Blockchain.
